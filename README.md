# kicad-packages3D-source

This repository contains source files for the 3D models found at https://gitlab.com/kicad/libraries/kicad-packages3D

These source files can be in the form of:

* **Scripts** - Scripts used to parametrically generate model files
* **Native 3D model Files** - e.g. FreeCad or openSCAD models, (etc)

Please note that free, open source program generated models are required due to maintenance reasons.  There is a preference for models generated by scripting to allow for parameteric expansion
